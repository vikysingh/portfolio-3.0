        <p>
            I’m a  FrontEnd developer and web designer based in Italy. 
            I started learning JavaScript back in 2019 and since then 
            I have made a lot of progress.
        </p>

            Other than FrontEnd development, I’ve also had experience
            working with WordPress.
